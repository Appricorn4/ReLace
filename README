# ReLace is a project to add software frame generation from outside games and eventually video through the use of interlacing
# the currently displayed frame with the current rendered frame in the GPU. The project is designed for the Wayland display
# protocol. The goal of the project is to artificially double framerates with as little as a 1-frame input delay. This project
# is FOR FUN and quality  will not be prioritized over functionality and stability.
